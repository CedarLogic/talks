COMMENTS TO AUTHOR (to help in revision of paper):\
\
\
The paper presents a reflective higher-order calculus called \
rho-calculus.\
The rho-calculus is built on a notion of quoting.  It features a "lift"\
operator to construct a name from a process and a "drop" operator to \
extract\
the process from a name.  In terms of expressive power, it is not clear\
whether the rho-calculus is better than the higher-order pi-calculus.  \
What\
is the advantage of the rho-calculus in contrast to the higher-order\
pi-calculus?  Authors may also need to cite Milner's paper -- "The \
Polyadic\
Pi-Calculus: a Tutorial", which presents the higher-order pi-calculus.\

7. COMMENTS TO EDITORS:\
\
\
A very interesting paper illustrating the expressive power of \
reflection. More precisely, the authors illustrate a variant of the pi-calculus, \
called \\rho-calculus, which contains operators for "quote" and \
"dequote", which allow to move from the language level to the meta-level and \
back. The authors show that in this calculus they can encode the "new" \
operator, and, thanks to the high-order features of the  calculus, they \
do not need recursion or replication.\
