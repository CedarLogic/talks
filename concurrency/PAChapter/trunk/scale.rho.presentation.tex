\chapter{Reflection} 
\section{A reflective calculus}

The next step in this process is to derive the reflective calculus
from the $\pi$-calculus. We observe that the calculus presented in the
previous section is not a closed theory, but rather a theory dependent
upon some theory of names. Operationally, one may think of the {\pic}
as a procedure that when handed a theory of names provides a theory of
processes that communicate over those names. In this section we
present a closed variation of the the {\pic} in which the \emph{codes}
of processes supply the set of names. Morally, we are solving a domain
equation \cite{}. If the set of process generated from the set of
names, $\mathcal{N}$, is denoted $\mathcal{P(N)}$, then we are seeking
a solution to the equation $\mathcal{N} = \mathcal{P(N)}$. Our
solution is entirely syntactic (`free' in the language of category
theory): we merely introduce a term constructor for names that
encloses process terms in quotes.

A blind application of this idea almost works. For technical
convenience, below we present the application to the minimal
asynchronous variant of the $\pi$-calculus without summation
\cite{}. But, in the richer calculus aimed at underpinning a general
purpose programming language summation is treated. More interestingly,
the reflective features make the calculus essentially higher order,
allowing replication to be eliminated as an operator, in the same way
that the $\lambda$-calculus can implement fix point combinators and
has no need to introduce them as native constructs. Also, in a higher
order setting, it turns out that there are two candidates for the
continuation of output: one is the process that remains on the
emitting side, the other is the process that is communicated. For
simplicity, we opt only to work with the latter. Even more
interestingly, it turns out that the restriction operator can be
implemented as well. This presentation essentially follows that of
\cite{meredith2005rho} of the \emph{r}eflective
\emph{h}igher-\emph{o}rder calculus, or rho-calculus for short, or
$\rho$-calculus for even shorter.

\subsubsection{Notation}

As before, we organize the generators along the lines of normal processes, agents and processes.

      \inferrule* [lab=name] {} {{x,y} \bc \quotep{P}}
    \end{mathpar}
  }
  \caption{ $\rho$-calculus process grammar }
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Notation}

It is useful to adopt analogs of the standard abbreviations, such as

\begin{mathpar}
   x?(\vec{y}).P := x.(\vec{y})P \and  x!\clift{\vec{Q}} := x.\clift{\vec{Q}}
\end{mathpar}

\subsubsection{Quote}

Working in a bottom-up fashion, we begin with names. The technical
detail corresponding to the {\pic}' parametricity in a theory of
\textit{names} shows up in standard presentations in the grammar
describing terms of the language: there is no production for names;
names are taken to be terminals in the grammar. Our first point of
departure from a more standard presentation of an asynchronous mobile
process calculus is here. The grammar for the terms of the language
will include a production for names in the grammar. A name is a
\textit{quoted} process, $\quotep{P}$.

\subsubsection{Parallel}

This constructor is the usual parallel composition, denoting
concurrent execution of the composed processes.

\subsubsection{Lift and drop}
As usual we maintain the syntactic category \emph{agent} of
abstractions ($(\vec{y})P$) and concretions ($\clift{\vec{Q}}$). The middle
choice of the first production allows agents to be \emph{located} at a
channel, e.g. $x.(\vec{y})P$ and $x.\clift{Q}$. The first form plays the
usual role of guarded input, but the second form needs a little
discussion. Despite the fact that names are built from (the codes of)
processes, we still maintain a careful disinction in kind between
process and name; thus, name construction is not process
construction. Thus, if we want to be able to generate a name from a
given process, there must be a process constructor for a term that
creates a name from a process. This is the motivation for the
production $x.\clift{\vec{Q}}$, dubbed here the \emph{lift} operator. The
intuitive meaning of this term is that the process $P$ will be
packaged up as its code, $\quotep{P}$, and ultimately made available
as an output at the port $x$.

A more formal motivation for the introduction of this operator will
become clear in the sequel. But, it will suffice to say now that
$\quotep{P}$ is impervious to substitution. In the $\rho$-calculus,
substitution does not affect the process body between quote marks. On
the other hand, $x.\clift{\vec{P}}$ is susceptible to substitution and as
such constitutes a dynamic form of quoting because the process body
ultimately quoted will be different depending on the context in which
the $x.\clift{\vec{P}}$ expression occurs.

Of course, when a name is a quoted process, it is very handy to have a
way of evaluating such an entity. Thus, the $\dropn{x}$ operator,
pronounced \textit{drop} $x$, (eventually) extracts the process from a
name. We say `eventually' because this extraction only happens when a
quoted process is substituted into this expression. A consequence of
this behavior is that $\dropn{x}$ is inert except under and input
prefix. One way of saying this is that if you want to get something
done, sometimes you need to drop a name, but it should be the name of
an agent you know.

\begin{remark} %{No $\nu$ is good news}
  The lift operator turns out to play a role analogous to $(\nu \;
  x)P$. As mentioned in the introduction, it is essential to the
  computational completeness of the calculus, playing a key role in
  the implementation of replication. It also provides an essential
  ingredient in the compositional encoding of the $\nu$ operator.
\end{remark}

\begin{remark} %{Dropping replication}
  It is well-known that replication is not required in a higher-order
  process algebra \cite{SangiorgiWalker}. While our algebra is
  \textit{not} higher-order in the traditional sense (there are not
  formal process variables of a different type from names) it has all
  the features of a higher-order process algebra. Thus, it turns out
  that there is no need for a term for recursion. To illustrate this
  we present below an encoding of $!P$ in this calculus. Intuitively,
  this will amount to receiving a quoted form of a process, evaluating
  it, while making the quoted form available again. The reader
  familiar with the $\lambda$-calculus will note the formal similarity
  between the crucial term in the encoding and the paradoxical
  combinator \cite{Barendregt84}.
\end{remark}

\subsubsection{Input and output}

The input constructor is standard for an asynchronous name-passing
calculus. Input blocks its continuation from execution until it
receives a communication. Lift is a form of output which -- because
the calculus is asynchronous -- is allowed no continuation. It also
affords a convenient syntactic sugar, which we define here.

\begin{eqnarray}
	x![y] \triangleq x!\clift{\dropn{y}} \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}

\subsubsection{The null process}

As we will see below, the null process has a more distinguished role
in this calculus. It provides the sole atom out of which all other
processes (and the names they use) arise much in the same way that the
number $0$ is the sole number out of which the natural numbers are
constructed; or the empty set is the sole set out of which all sets
are built in $ZF$-set theory \cite{Krivine-TheCurryHowardCorre}; or
the empty game is the sole game out of which all games are built in
Conway's theory of games and numbers \cite{ONAG}. This analogy to
these other theories draws attention, in our opinion, to the
foundational issues raised in the introduction regarding the design of
calculi of interaction.

\subsection{The name game}

Before presenting some of the more standard features of a mobile
process calculus, the calculation of free names, structural
equivalence, etc., we wish to consider some examples of processes and
names. In particular, if processes are built out of names, and names
are built out of processes, is it ever possible to get off the ground?
Fortunately, there is one process the construction of which involves
no names, the null process, $0$. Since we have at least one process,
we can construct at least one name, namely $\quotep{0}$ \footnote{pun
gratefully accepted ;-)}. Armed with one name we can now construct at
least two new processes that are evidently syntactically different
from the $0$, these are $\quotep{0}[{\quotep{0}}]$ and
$\quotep{0}({\quotep{0}}) \concat 0$. As we might expect,
the intuitive operational interpretation of these processes is also
distinct from the null process. Intuitively, we expect that the first
outputs the name $\quotep{0}$ on the channel $\quotep{0}$, much like
the ordinary {\pic} process $x![x]$ outputs the name $x$ on
the channel $x$, and the second inputs on the channel $\quotep{0}$,
much like the ordinary {\pic} process $x?(x) \concat 0$
inputs on the channel $x$.

Of course, now that we have two more processes, we have two more
names, $\quotep{\quotep{0}[{\quotep{0}}]}$ and
$\quotep{\quotep{0}({\quotep{0}}) \concat 0}$. Having three names at
our disposal we can construct a whole new supply of processes that
generate a fresh supply of names, and we're off and running. It should
be pointed out, though, that as soon as we had the null process we
also had $0|0$ and $0|0|0$ and consequently, we had the names
$\quotep{ 0|0 }$, and $\quotep{0|0|0}$, and .... But, since we
ultimately wish to treat these compositions as merely other ways of
writing the null process and not distinct from it, should we admit the
codes of these processes as distinct from $\quotep{0}$?

\subsection{Free and bound names}

The syntax has been chosen so that a binding occurrence of a name is
sandwiched between round braces, $( \cdot )$. Thus, the
calculation of the free names of a process, $P$, denoted
$\freenames{P}$ is given recursively by

\begin{figure}[tbp]
  \centering
  \Ovalbox{
    \begin{mathpar}
      \freenames{\pzero} := \emptyset
      \and
      \freenames{x(y).P} := \{ x \} \cup \freenames{P} \setminus \{ y \}
      \and
      \freenames{\lift{x}{P}} := \{ x \} \cup \freenames{P}
      \and
      \freenames{\dropn{x}} := \{ x \}
      \and
      \freenames{\binpar{P}{Q}} := \freenames{P} \cup \freenames{Q}
    \end{mathpar}
  }
  \caption{ $\rho$-calculus free name calculation }
\end{figure}

An occurrence of $x$ in a process $P$ is \textit{bound} if it is not
free. The set of names occurring in a process (bound or free) is
denoted by $\names{P}$.

\subsection{Structural congruence}

The {\em structural congruence} of processes, noted $\scong$, is the
least congruence, containing $\alpha$-equivalence, $\alphaeq$, that
satisfies the following laws:

\begin{figure}[hbp]
  \centering
  \Ovalbox{
    \begin{mathpar}
      \inferrule*[] {} {{P} | \pzero \scong \; {P} \; \scong \pzero | {P}} 
      \and
      \inferrule*[] {} {{P} | {Q} \scong {Q} | {P}}
      \and
      \inferrule*[] {} {({P} \juxtap {Q}) \juxtap {R} \scong {P} \juxtap ({Q} \juxtap {R})}
    \end{mathpar}
  }
  \caption{ $\rho$-calculus structural equivalence }
\end{figure}

\subsection{Name equivalence}

We take name equivalence, written $\nameeq$, to be the smallest
equivalence relation generated by the following rules.

\begin{figure}[hbp]
  \centering
  \Ovalbox{
    \begin{mathpar}
      \inferrule*[]{ } { \quotep{\dropn{x}} \nameeq x }
      \and
      \inferrule*[]{ P \scong Q }{ \quotep{P} \nameeq \quotep{Q} }
    \end{mathpar}
  }
  \caption{ $\rho$-calculus name equivalence }
\end{figure}

\subsection{Syntactic substitution}

Now we build the substitution used by $\alpha$-equivalence. We use
$\Proc$ for the set of processes, $\QProc$ for the set of names, and
$\id{\{}\vec{y} / \vec{x} \id{\}}$ to denote partial maps, $s : \QProc
\rightarrow \QProc$. A map, $s$ lifts, uniquely, to a map on process terms, $\widehat{s} :
\Proc \rightarrow \Proc$ by the following equations.

\begin{figure}[hbp]
  \centering
  \Ovalbox{
    \begin{mathpar}
      \inferrule*[]{}{(0) \psubstp{Q}{P} := 0}
      \and \\
      \inferrule*[]{}{(R | S) \psubstp{Q}{P} := (R)\psubstp{Q}{P} | (S) \psubstp{Q}{P}}
      \and \\
      \inferrule*[]{}{(x \id{(} y\id{)}\concat R) \psubstp{Q}{P} := (x)\substp{Q}{P} \id{(}z\id{)}\concat( (R \psubstn{z}{y}) \psubstp{Q}{P} )}
      \and \\
      \inferrule*[]{}{(\lift{x}{R}) \psubstp{Q}{P} := \lift{(x)\substp{Q}{P}}{ R \psubstp{Q}{P} }}
      \and \\
      \inferrule*[]{x \nameeq \quotep{P}}{(\dropn{x}) \psubstp{Q}{P} := \dropn{\quotep{Q}}}
      \and
      \inferrule*[]{x \not\nameeq \quotep{P}}{(\dropn{x}) \psubstp{Q}{P} := \dropn{x}}
    \end{mathpar}
  }
  \caption{ $\rho$-calculus semantic substitution }
\end{figure}

where

\begin{eqnarray}
  (x)\id{\{} \lpquote Q \rpquote / \lpquote P \rpquote \id{\}}            = 
  \left\{ 
    \begin{array}{ccc}
      \lpquote Q \rpquote & & x \nameeq \lpquote P \rpquote \\
      x & & otherwise \\
    \end{array}
  \right. \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}

and $z$ is chosen distinct from $\quotep{P}$, $\quotep{Q}$, the free
names in $Q$, and all the names in $R$. Our $\alpha$-equivalence will
be built in the standard way from this substitution.

\subsection{ Dynamic quote: an example }

Anticipating something of what's to come, consider applying the
substitution, $\widehat{\id{\{}u / z \id{\}}}$, to the following pair
of processes, $w!\clift{y![z]}$ and $w![\lpquote y![z] \rpquote]$.

\begin{eqnarray}
  w!\clift{y![z]}\widehat{\id{\{}u / z \id{\}}}
  & = &
  w!\clift{y![u]} \nonumber\\
  w![\lpquote y![z] \rpquote] \widehat{ \id{\{}u / z \id{\}} }
  & = &
  w![ \lpquote y![z] \rpquote] \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}

Because the body of the process between quotes is impervious to
substitution, we get radically different answers. In fact, by
examining the first process in an input context,
e.g. $x?(z).w!\clift{y![z]}$, we see that the process under the lift
operator may be shaped by prefixed inputs binding a name inside it. In
this sense, the lift operator will be seen as a way to dynamically
construct processes before reifying them as names.

\subsection{Semantic substitution}

The substitution used in $\alpha$-equivalence is really only a device
to formally recognize that binding occurrences do not depend on the
specific names. It is not the engine of computation. The proposal here
is that while synchronization is the driver of that engine, the real
engine of computation is a semantic notion of substitution that
recognizes that a dropped name is a request to run a process. Which
process? Why the one whose code has been bound to the name being
dropped. Formally, this amounts to a notion of substitution that
differs from syntactic substitution in its application to a dropped
name.

\begin{eqnarray}
(\dropn{x})  \psubstp{Q}{P}       
		& = & 
		\left\{ 
			\begin{array}{ccc} 
				Q & & x \nameeq \quotep{P} \\
                              	\dropn{x} & & otherwise \\
			\end{array}
		\right. \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}

In the remainder of the paper we will refer to semantic and syntactic
substitutions simply as substitutions and rely on context to
distinguish which is meant. Similarly, we will abuse notation and
write $\substn{y}{x}$ for $\psubstn{y}{x}$.

Finally equipped with these standard features we can present the
dynamics of the calculus.

\subsection{Operational Semantics}
The reduction rules for {\rhoc}  are
\begin{figure}[hbp]
  \centering
  \Ovalbox{
    \begin{mathpar}
      \inferrule*[lab=Comm]{ {x}_{src} \nameeq {x}_{trgt} \andalso |\vec{Q}| = |\vec{y}| }
      {{{x_{src}}.\clift{\vec{Q}} | { x_{trgt}.(\vec{y}){P}}}
        \red {P}\id{\{}\quotep{Q_0} \id{/} {y_0}, \ldots, \quotep{Q_n} \id{/} {y_n} \id{\}}}
      \and \\
      \inferrule*[lab=Par]{{P} \red {P}'}{{{P}|{Q}} \red {{P}'|{Q}}}
      \and
      \inferrule*[lab=Equiv]{{{P} \scong {P}'} \andalso {{P}' \red {Q}'} \andalso {{Q}' \scong {Q}}}{{P} \red {Q}}
    \end{mathpar}
  }
  \caption{ $\rho$-calculus reduction relation }
\end{figure}

% In addition, we have the following context rules:

% \infrule[Par]{{P} \red {P}'}{{{P} \juxtap {Q}} \red {{P}' \juxtap {Q}}}

% \infrule[Equiv]{{{P} \scong {P}'} \andalso {{P}' \red {Q}'} \andalso {{Q}' \scong {Q}}}{{P} \red {Q}}

The context rules are entirely standard and we do not say much about
them, here. The communication rule does what was promised, namely make
it possible for agents to synchronize and communicate processes
packaged as names. For example, using the comm rule and name
equivalence we can now justify our syntactic sugar for output.

% \begin{eqnarray}
%   & {x}![z] | x?(y).P & \nonumber\\
%   = 
%   & {x}!\clift{\dropn{z}} | x?(y).P & \nonumber\\
%   \red 
%   & P \substn{\quotep{\dropn{z}}}{y} & \nonumber\\
%   \scong & P \substn{z}{y} & \nonumber
% \end{eqnarray}

\begin{mathpar}
  \inferrule* [] {} {{x}![z] | x?(y).P = {x}!\clift{\dropn{z}} | x?(y).P \red  P \substn{\quotep{\dropn{z}}}{y} \scong  P \substn{z}{y}}
\end{mathpar}

But, it also provides a scheme that identifies the role of name
equality in synchronization. We explore this family of calculi in a
forthcoming paper. For the rest of this paper, however, we restrict
our attention to the calculus with the less exotic communication rule,
using $\red$ for reduction according to that system and $\wred$ for
$\red^*$.

\section{Replication}

As mentioned before, it is known that replication (and hence
recursion) can be implemented in a higher-order process algebra
\cite{SangiorgiWalker}. As our first example of calculation with the
machinery thus far presented we give the construction explicitly in
the {\rhoc}.

% \begin{eqnarray}
%   D(x) & \triangleq & \prefix{x}{y}{(\binpar{\outputp{x}{y}}{\dropn{y}})} \nonumber\\
%   \bangp{P}(x) & \triangleq & \binpar{\lift{x}{\binpar{D(x)}{P}}}{D(x)} \nonumber
% \end{eqnarray}
\begin{mathpar}
  \inferrule* [] {} {D(x) := \prefix{x}{y}{(\binpar{\outputp{x}{y}}{\dropn{y}})}}
  \andalso
  \inferrule* [] {} {\bangp{P}(x) := \binpar{\lift{x}{\binpar{D(x)}{P}}}{D(x)}}
\end{mathpar}

\begin{eqnarray}
  \bangp{P}(x) & & \nonumber\\
  =
  & \binpar{\lift{x}{\binpar{D(x)}{P}}}{D(x)} & \nonumber\\
  =
  & \lift{x}{(\prefix{x}{y}{(\outputp{x}{y} | \dropn{y})) | P}} 
  | \prefix{x}{y}{(\outputp{x}{y} | \dropn{y})} & \nonumber\\
  \red
  & (\outputp{x}{y} | \dropn{y})\substn{\quotep{(\prefix{x}{y}{(\dropn{y} | \outputp{x}{y})) | P}}}{y} & \nonumber\\
  =
  & \outputp{x}{\quotep{(\prefix{x}{y}{(\outputp{x}{y} | \dropn{y})) | P}}}
  | {(\prefix{x}{y}{(\outputp{x}{y} | \dropn{y})) | P}} & \nonumber\\
  =
  & \outputp{x}{\quotep{D(x)| P}}|{D(x)|P} & \nonumber\\
  \red
  & \ldots & \nonumber\\
  \red^*
  & P | P | \ldots & \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}

Of course, this encoding, as an implementation, runs away, unfolding
$\bangp{P}$ eagerly. A lazier and more implementable replication
operator, restricted to input-guarded processes, may be obtained as follows.

\begin{eqnarray}
\bangp{\prefix{u}{v}{P}} 
	\triangleq 
	\binpar{\lift{x}{\prefix{u}{v}{(\binpar{D(x)}{P})}}}{D(x)} \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}

It is worth noting that the lift operator is essential to get
computational completeness. 

\section{Bisimulation}

Having taken the notion of restriction out of the language, we
carefully place it back into the notion of observation, and hence into
the notion of program equality, i.e. bisimulation. That is, we
parameterize the notion of barbed bisimulation by a set of names over
which we are allowed to set the barbs. The motivation for this choice
is really comparison with other calculi. The set of names of the
{\rhoc} is \textit{global}. It is impossible, in the grammar of
processes, to guard terms from being placed into contexts that can
potentially observe communication. So, we provide a place for
reasoning about such limitations on the scope of observation in the
theory of bisimulation.

\begin{remark}
  Because this point about names and observation is somewhat subtle,
  it is worthwhile comparing this situation to Milner's original
  calculus. In the $\pi$-calculus we have the $\nu$ operator that
  scopes names and ostensibly limits observations. But, if we review
  the situation carefully, we see that Milner's presentation demands
  \emph{both} a countably infinite set of names \emph{and} an
  effective equality on these names. This pair of demands cannot be
  realized on a computer for \emph{atomic} names, i.e. names without
  structure. To achieve both demands on a computer the structure of
  names and how those names are compared for equality \emph{has} to be
  revealed. Thus, for \emph{any} effective realization of the
  $\pi$-calculus the name set is \emph{always global}. This means that
  in any effective presentation of Milner's calculus $\nu$ scopes are
  meaningless in terms of protection against barbs. To bring this
  point home, in an effective presentation of the $\pi$-calculus the
  term $(\nu \; x)x?(y).0$ cannot be bisimilar to $\pzero$ because the
  program has to pick a binding for $x$ and after finite guesses for
  $x$ an attacker of the form $x!(z).exploit!(x)$ will signal the
  binding of $x$ on the channel $exploit$.
\end{remark}

\begin{definition}
An \emph{observation relation}, $\downarrow_{\mathcal N}$, over a set
of names, $\mathcal N$, is the smallest relation satisfying the rules
below.

\infrule[Out-barb]{y \in {\mathcal N}, \; x \nameeq y}
		  {\outputp{x}{v} \downarrow_{\mathcal N} x}
\infrule[Par-barb]{\mbox{$P\downarrow_{\mathcal N} x$ or $Q\downarrow_{\mathcal N} x$}}
		  {\binpar{P}{Q} \downarrow_{\mathcal N} x}

We write $P \Downarrow_{\mathcal N} x$ if there is $Q$ such that 
$P \wred Q$ and $Q \downarrow_{\mathcal N} x$.
\end{definition}

Notice that $\prefix{x}{y}{P}$ has no barb.  Indeed, in {\rhoc} as well
as other asynchronous calculi, an observer has no direct means to
detect if a message sent has been received or not.

\begin{definition}
%\label{def.bbisim}
An  ${\mathcal N}$-\emph{barbed bisimulation} over a set of names, ${\mathcal N}$, is a symmetric binary relation 
${\mathcal S}_{\mathcal N}$ between agents such that $P\rel{S}_{\mathcal N}Q$ implies:
\begin{enumerate}
\item If $P \red P'$ then $Q \wred Q'$ and $P'\rel{S}_{\mathcal N} Q'$.
\item If $P\downarrow_{\mathcal N} x$, then $Q\Downarrow_{\mathcal N} x$.
\end{enumerate}
$P$ is ${\mathcal N}$-barbed bisimilar to $Q$, written
$P \wbbisim_{\mathcal N} Q$, if $P \rel{S}_{\mathcal N} Q$ for some ${\mathcal N}$-barbed bisimulation ${\mathcal S}_{\mathcal N}$.
\end{definition}
