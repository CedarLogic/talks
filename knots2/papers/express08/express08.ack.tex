\paragraph{Acknowledgments.}
The authors wish to thank Matthias Radestock for suggestions for
coding wires, and early advocation of the wire-saturated form the
final encoding took and his probing questions regarding proof
strategies in earlier drafts of this paper. One of the co-author
wishes to acknowledge his longstanding debt to Samson Abramksy for
making so accessible his foundational insights into the Curry-Howard
isomorphism. Additionally, the authors would like to thank the
reviewers of ICALP 2006 for their helpful comments on an earlier write
up of these results.
