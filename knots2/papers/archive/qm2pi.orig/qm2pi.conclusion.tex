\section{Conclusions and future work}

\paragraph{Testing physical space}
You, gentle reader, may wonder why of all the theorems to be proved
given this set up we pick the one above. In some sense it's hardly
central to quantum mechanics. We see it as central in the sense that
it firmly establishes a notion of physical space arising from a notion
of the equivalence of behavior. Relating bisimulation to a metric is a
big step forward, but one is faced with interpreting the relationship
of that metric space to something more physical. Quantum mechanical
notions of ``physical'' space are still far from intuitive, but by
relating this idea of distance as testing to calculations that predict
physical circumstances we are making a not insignificant step forward
toward an understanding of the physical space we inhabit as
essentially dynamic.

\paragraph{Effectivity and simulation}
One of the observations we have yet to make is that the entire program
spelled out here is effective. We have built various interpreters for
the reflective calculus at work in this interpretation. In principle,
then, we can simulate quantum mechanics on a computer. The place where
the simulation may lose fidelity is the infinitely branching summation
for the annihilator.

In this connection i also want to point out that the evaluation style
calculation of the inner product puts the non-determinism of the
summation right at the heart of measurement. This suggests that
Milner's original reduction-based formulation of the dynamics of his
calculi in terms of sums was not just notationally suggestive of a
notion of measure-and-continue but captured some significant part of
the physics.

\paragraph{Quantum continuations}
In light of this last observation i want to point out that the
predominant account of quantum mechanics is missing a key aspect of a
truly compositional story of the physical situation. In a real lab,
when a measurement is made the observation can be made to feed into
another device that then makes another measurement conditioned on the
results of the first. This means that after the superposition was
collapsed the entire experimental set up remained in
superposition. While QM offers a means of writing this down it doesn't
quite line up well with the well-trodden formulation of computation
and continuation that we see so succinctly expressed in Milner's
calculi. This suggests that there might be advantages to this account
of dynamics waiting to be explored.

\paragraph{Quantum logic}
In this connection, we also note that by virtue of having the
Hennessy-Milner construction, we can pull the construction through the
interpretation of QM. This gives us a natural candidate for a quantum
logic that enjoys an extremely tight connection with it's domain of
interpretation, making the construction much less ad hoc (rather it is
the image of functor!).

\paragraph{Quantum probabiity}
i have questions about the basis of the interpretation of inner
product as probability amplitude. In particular, using which
axiomatization of probability theory does the notion of probability
amplitude earn the right to be so dubbed? In other words, where is the
proof that the operation for calculating a probability amplitude (and
then squaring) satisfies the axioms of what it means to calculate a
probability? Even if such a proof exists (i have yet to find it in the
literature), i wonder if it might not be possible to turn things on
their heads. Can we view the calculation of the probability amplitude
as an axiomatization of probability? If so, then the definition we
give for calculating probability amplitude may provide the basis for
an \emph{effective} theory of probability.

\paragraph{Quantum vs ``biological'' information}
Finally, i want to conclude with a more philosophical observation. At
a recent workshop in which QM was a predominant topic i noticed
something about quantum information. The speaker was giving a riveting
discussion of axiomatic QM and showing how properties of ``no
cloning'' and ``no deleting'' emerged as consequences of the
axiomatization. Theorems of this form are necessary to give us a sense
of confidence that our axioms characterize the physical theory. What
struck me, though, was that if quantum information is neither erasable
nor replicable it is markedly different from \emph{life}. Two of the
things we know about life is that

\begin{itemize}
  \item it ends;
  \item to gain some measure of persistence, to transcend it's
    finitude it is imminently copyable.
\end{itemize}

Both of these qualities are summarized succinctly in the aphorism: all
flesh is grass. For me these two kinds of ``information'' -- call them
quantum and biological -- are end points on a spectrum of strategies
for persistence. At one end, we have those curious entities that enjoy
uniqueness and permanence; at the other, we have those who in the face
of a certain end and an uncertain present make a go of passing
something on. To me one of the more remarkable aspects of the latter
strategy is that in the presence of noise (and certain features of
copying) we get a kind of dynamism, a chance for improvement against a
given persistent condition.
